# [ðŸ’¬ AI Real Estate Assistant App](https://ai-real-estate-assistant.streamlit.app/)

The assistant should engage users in a conversation, asking questions about their preferences such as:
- location (city, neighborhood)
- budget range
- property type (apartment, house, condo)
- number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- desired amenities (parking, garden, pool)
- proximity to schools or public transportation.

# [ðŸ’¬ AI Real Estate Assistant App](https://ai-real-estate-assistant.streamlit.app/)

## Requirements
Develop an AI-powered assistant for a real estate agency that assists potential buyers and renters in finding their ideal property.

The assistant should engage users in a conversation, asking questions about their preferences such as:
- location (city, neighborhood)
- budget range
- property type (apartment, house, condo)
- number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- desired amenities (parking, garden, pool)
- proximity to schools or public transportation.


## Description
POC app will have simple UI and will use local [real csv dataset for Poland](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/krzysztofjamroz/apartment-prices-in-poland) (github hosted [apartments_rent_pl_2024_06.csv](dataset%2Fapartments_rent_pl_2024_06.csv)).
